## TexWatch

This is a simple script used to watch and compile .tex files into pdfs on Unix systems.

To set up, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gavinbarrett/LatexWatcher
cd LatexWatcher
chmod +x texwatch.sh
```

You will need to have **Latex** and **pdflatex** installed on your computer.

Then add latexw.sh to your path.

Then you can run `./texwatch file.tex` to watch and compile file.tex.
